### The game's Info:

Hello JS warrior! Are you ready to be Javascriptin' ? 🚀

A group of rogue programming languages broke into your files and are trying to damage your code by inserting their own, turning yours into pure giberish!! We can't let that happen! 😱

Your objective is to dodge the incoming programming languages in order to keep your code integrity for as long as possible. 🏆

You can also shoot ERROR 404's to get other languages out of the way, increasing your score!

Be on the lookout for incoming JS libraries and frameworks for more ammo.

Good Luck!
